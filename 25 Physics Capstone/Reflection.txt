Reflection
I did not finish my needs to have list, but I was partially expecting that. When I made that list, I was unaware that I would be missing a week of school and I already thought it was quite an ambitious list at the time. I had planned on doing 7 physics units and I only ended up finishing 2. Regardless, I am overall happy with what I was able to complete in the time given. The hardest parts of the project was building the separate classes during the transition between the 2 units. I had assumed that the 2 classes would be nearly identical, but I ended up needing to change quite a bit more than I thought. Which at that point, was the moment I realized I wasn't gonna be getting much more done than those 2 units, since the classes I planned on making in the future were gonna need the same amount if not more change. It ended up feeling like I was making 2 separate mini projects instead of 1 major project. If I were to start a project like this again, I should continue being ambitious about it like I was this time. I think it's a good thing that I was so ambitious. In the end, it felt like I barely completed anything I wanted to but I would've completed even less if I wasn't ambitious.
